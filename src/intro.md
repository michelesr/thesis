## Context

### beFair

<!-- link to: http://docs.befair.it/doku.php?id=ilprogetto  -->
The *beFair* team is an organisation that bases its root in the following principles:

- Develop the territories with technologies, methods and practices for society ethics and solidarity

- Offer tools and technology solutions with Free Software, favoring network strategies to make life easier and increase the effectiveness of activities.

- Adopt an agile development process in order to maximize efficiency and flexibility of the products

My collaboration with the beFair team begins at the first months of this year, when the team realized that a boost in the quality of the development process and final product could be obtained with the application of automated software testing.


### FLOSS

<!-- link to: https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html -->

As a team, we think that in the contemporary context, the software that we develop has to follow the FLOSS (Free Libre and Open Source Software) principles, that are explained in detail in the *GNU* project website: 

> *“Free software” means software that respects users' freedom and community. Roughly, it means that the users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software. Thus, “free software” is a matter of liberty, not price. To understand the concept, you should think of “free” as in “free speech,” not as in “free beer”. We sometimes call it “libre software” to show we do not mean it is gratis.*

In fact, free doesn't mean gratis, but means that if the user obtain the software, it has also the right to do all the things listed above.

<!-- Free software lays the foundations for an era in which there will be no more secrets and patents, but the ideas will be made available to all immediately, placing the collective interest above that of a few select individuals. Free Software is shared knowledge, that use the network as a tool for spreading. -->

### Social Business

### Agile development process

<!-- link to http://www.agilemanifesto.org/ -->
Another mainstay of the beFair team is the agile development process, that is described in the *Manifesto for Agile Software Development*. The main points of agile development process are:

- *Individuals and interactions over processes and tools*
- *Working software over comprehensive documentation*
- *Customer collaboration over contract negotiation*
- *Responding to change over following a plan*

In this manifesto, priorities are given in the development process, but the concepts with lower priority remain fundamentals. Agile means embracing the change, over following a plan, that fits the client needs in a more direct way. In this context, automated tests are necessary in order to achieve continuous delivery of the product.

## Improvement of beFair products

In order to improve beFair software products, we have review our software architecture to fit the microservices model, that emerged out recently and became a standard for many organisations, such as *Google* and *Red Hat*. 

This approach is based to divide the application microservices isolated inside containers, that can communicate with a Virtual Private Network (VPN). Containers provide many advantages if used in production and they will replace Virtual Machines soon.
